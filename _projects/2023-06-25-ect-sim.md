Joint work with Julien Gosez, Dr. Nicolas Langbour, Prof. Nemat Jaafari, Dr. Diane Levy-Chavagnat, Dr. Marco Sensale, Dr. Ghina Harika-Germaneau. Compared current distribution between the bifrontal and right unilateral montage from ECT schizophrenia treatments using the finite element method, finding that alternating the montage may help trigger convulsions, potentially activating different neural networks and neurons. 

Did a poster session at the European Conference on Brain Stimulation in Mental Health.
